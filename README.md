# üìå LangChain Agents (2025)

LangChain Agents are intelligent components that combine **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **tools or APIs** to autonomously solve complex tasks. Unlike standard LLMs that only generate text, agents **reason, plan, and take actions** based on the user query.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Prompts from LangChain Hub**

LangChain Hub provides prebuilt **agent prompts** to help developers quickly set up agents for various use cases.  

| Prompt Name | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Zero Shot Agent | Agent decides which tool to use without examples | Simple, dynamic task execution |
| ReAct Agent | Uses reasoning + acting in steps | Complex multi-step reasoning |
| Conversational Agent | Maintains context in a conversation | Chatbots with memory |
| Plan-and-Act Agent | Plans multiple steps before execution | Multi-tool workflows |
| Tool-Using Agent | Uses multiple external tools to answer queries | Retrieval, API calls, or calculations |

> You can find all prompts on the [LangChain Hub](https://www.langchain.com/hub).

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ How Agents Work**

1. **Observe** ‚Üí Analyze the query or environment.  
2. **Decide** ‚Üí Pick the tool or action.  
3. **Act** ‚Üí Execute the chosen tool.  
4. **Repeat** ‚Üí Continue until the goal is achieved.  

**Example Conceptual Flow:**
User: "Find the latest stock price of Tesla and its market news."
Agent:

Call stock price API ‚Üí get Tesla price

Call news API ‚Üí get recent news

Combine results ‚Üí Respond to user
